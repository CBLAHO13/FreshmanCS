This is a C++ program. It should compile and run like any other C++ program. 
Use Visual Studio to run, as detailed in the User Manual.
On the offchance that it does not work, please email me at colleen.p.blaho@glink.drexel.edu.
I'd be happy to help get things running, or show you on my own laptop. 

Enclosed in the archive is an executable file. This file was compiled on my own computer (64 bit Win8.1).
If it does not work on your computer, please compile it on your own computer before failing me. If it still
doesn't work, please email me. This code has been compiled successfully on Windows, so I really would
love to see what was going wrong! 

Code created with the help of Visual Studio.
Thanks to Max Mattes for inspiration and keeping me from throwing my computer off the roof of the new Lebow Building.
Lines 120 and 123 are credited in the program. Everything else is 1's and 0's that are my intellectual property.
