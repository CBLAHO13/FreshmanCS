<!-- Tux the Virtual Pest. 
PART 2 CHANGE LOG
This is a preliminary of the the User Interface. Subject to change.
In fact, it's already changed. I've decided that the bare minimum looks stupid. 
Also, I have some funny ideas. The Radio form will "dead end" Tux one way or another. 
The Terminal states will include: 
** Pissing him off so much that he commits suicide via sudo rm -rf / (by !vi /etc/inittab && id:6:initdefault: which creates infinite rebooting. Gah. redirects to dead)
** Accidentally breaking him through badly formed bash commands (the dreaded dd /dev/null combo! redirects to dead)
** Fork bombing him (redirects to dead)
** sudo shutdown -h now (redirects to turned off and gives an option to restart him)
** Sending a malformed Magic System Request (redirects to turned off and gives an option to restart him)
If I think of more, I'll add more. 

Another Change: The text "Install program from Source" will be changed to "sudo apt-get upgrade". Updates are far more important than source installations. 

PART 3 CHANGE LOG
Minor changes to aesthetics
Added Scripts and functions
Added redirect pages

Fun bits: 
	*Extra pages triggered by the radio buttons
