This pest will oscillate between happy, calm and thinking until it enters the “coding” state. The only
way to change this state is to use the radio form or click the “Use Windows” button. Doing this will put
it into the “enraged” state. From there, the pest will either self terminate (1/100 chance) or become
happy again when the “sudo apt-get upgrade” button is clicked.
