This is a Java program. It should compile and run like any other Java program. 
Use the commands javac to compile and java to run, as detailed in the User Manual.
On the offchance that it does not work, please email me at colleen.p.blaho@glink.drexel.edu.
I'd be happy to help get things running, or show you on my own laptop. 

Enclosed in the archive is an executable class file. This file was compiled on my own computer (64 bit Win8).
If it does not work on your computer, please compile it on your own computer before failing me. If it still
doesn't work, please email me. This code has been compiled successfully on Windows and Ubuntu Linux, so I really would
love to see what was going wrong! 

Code created with the help of Eclipse.
Thanks to Max Mattes for inspiration and keeping me from throwing my computer off the roof of my residence hall.
